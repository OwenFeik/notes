\chapter*{Sets}
\begin{flushleft}

\section*{Common Sets}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbb{N} is the set of positive integers: \(\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, ... \}\)
\item \textbb{Z} is the set of all integers: \(\{ ..., -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... \}\)
\item \textbb{Q} is the set of rational numbers, those that can be written as fractions
\item \textbb{R} is the set of real numbers.
\item \textbb{C} is the set of complex numbers.        
\end{itemize}


\[\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C}\]
Some numbers cannot be written as fractions, and these we describe as irrational. 
These include \(\pi\), \(e\), \(\sqrt{2}\), etc. These numbers are not in \textbb{Q}, but they are real numbers, i.e. in \textbb{R}. 
It can be difficult to prove numbers are irrational. An even larger set of numbers exists, that of the complex numbers \textbb{C}. ``Most'' real numbers are inrrational.


\section*{Denoting Membership}
If \(A\) is a set, saying \(x \in A\) means \(x\) is in the set \(A\). 
We can also use \(\notin\) to denote non-membership. 
Sets can be expressed as 2-dimensional regions, with points within them as elements.

\begin{itemize}
\item \(n \in \mathbb{Z}\) means \(n\) is an integer.
\item \(x \in \mathbb{Q}\) means \(x\) can be expressed as a fraction.
\end{itemize}

Note that \(n\) is used in the first example while \(x\) is used in the second; conventionally, \(n\) is used to represent integers.


\section*{Desciptive Notation}
Descriptive notation is a way of defining a set by stating a property which all of its elements possess. 
For example: 
\[A = \{x \in \mathbb{R} | x^2 + 1 > 37\}\]
Which can be read as the set of all real numbers \(x\) such that \(x^2 + 1 > 37\). 
The statement must be a ``predicate''; it must be true or false for all values. 
The vertical bar is read as ``such that''. A colon is sometimes used instead.

\subsubsection*{Examples}

\begin{itemize}
\item Express the set of real numbers whose natural (base \(e\)) logarithm is positive with descriptive notation: \({x \in \mathbb{R} | log(x) > 0}\). 
Note that \(log(x)\) denotes \(log_{e}(x)\). There is however an issue with this answer; 
because \(log(x)\) is sometimes undefined, ``\(log(x) > 0\)'' is not a predicate. The set could instead be expressed as:
\[\{x \in \mathbb{R}_{\scriptscriptstyle{>0}} | log(x) > 0\}\;\;\;\mathbb{R}_{\scriptscriptstyle{>0}} = \{x \in \mathbb{R} | x > 0\}\]
\item Express the set of integers whose cube is even in descriptive notation: 
\[\{n \in \mathbb{Z} | n^3 \:\mathrm{is\:even}\}\]
\item Describe the set \(\{n \in \mathbb{N} | sin(n) > 0\}\) in words: 
\begin{quotation}
The set of all natural numbers n such that sin(n) is greater than 0.
\end{quotation}
\end{itemize}


\section*{Abbreviated Notation}
Set notation is often abbreviated. For example \(\{x \in \mathbb{R} | sin(x) = 0\}\) could be expressed as:
\[\{k\pi | k \in \mathbb{Z}\}\]
This will be all integer multiples of pi; i.e. all values for which sin(x) = 0. 
This could also be expressed as: 
\[\{x \in \mathbb{R} | x = k\pi \:\mathrm{for\:some}\:k \in \mathbb{Z}\}\]
This can be thought of as a kind of ``generating'' notation, whereas descriptive notation
could be seen to excise a set from a larger set through a condition.

\subsubsection*{Examples}

\begin{itemize}
\item Express the set of odd integers in abbreviated set notation: 
\[\{2k + 1 | k \in \mathbb{Z}\} \:\mathrm{or}\: \{2k - 1 | k \in \mathbb{Z}\}\]
\item Express the set \(\{x \in \mathbb{R} | cos(x) = 0\}\) in abbreviated set notation: 
\[\{\frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi | k \in \mathbb{Z}\}\]
\end{itemize}


\section*{Intervals}
\((a, b)\) means the set of real numbers between \(a\) and \(b\) (exclusive). Therefore:
\[(a, b) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} | a < x and x < b\} = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} | a < x < b\} \]
This can be illustrated on a number line with an open circle at \(a\) and \(b\). This is an open interval.
To denote a close interval (inclusive of \(a\) and \(b\).

\subsubsection*{Examples}
Give definitions of \([A, b)\) and \((a, b]\) with diagrams: 

\section*{Unbounded Intervals}
For any \(a \in \mathbb{R}\), 
\[(-\inf, a) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} | x < a\}\]
Note that \(-\inf and \inf\) are not elements of \textbb{R}.

\section*{Small Sets}
Sets with finitely many elements can be described with a list of elements.
\[\{x \in R | x^2 - 1 = 0\} = \{-1, 1\}\]
\[\{x \in Z | x^2 - 1 < 0\} = \{0\}\]
\[\{x \in Z | x^3 - x = 0\} = \{-1, 0, 1\}\]

Write the set of prime numbers less than 20 in descriptive and list of elements form:
\[\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19\}\]

We can use a kind of "list of elements" notation to denote some infinite sets with ellipses.
For example: \[(2k + 1)\pi | k \in \mathbb{Z} = \{..., -3\pi, -\pi, \pi, 3\pi, ...\}\]
Express the set \(\{k\pi | k \in \mathbb{Z\}\)

The smallest set is taken to be the empty set, written as \(\emptyset\). It can also be written as 
\(\{\}\) in list of elements form.

\subsubsection*{Examples}
\[\{x \in \mathbb{R} | x^2 + 1 = 0\} = \emptyset\]
\[\{x \in \mathbb{R} | cos(x) > 1\} = \emptyset\]

\section*{Subsets}
If \(A\) and \(B\) are sets then \(A \subset B\) means that every element of \(A\) is also an element
of \(B\). It is read as \(A\) is a subset of \(B\).
\[x \in A \rightarrow x \in B\]

The empty set is taken to be a subset of every set.

\section*{Proofs}
A proof begins with a set of true assumptions, from which mathematical reasoning is used
to prove a conclusion.
To prove \(A \subset B\), we need to show that if something meets the criteria of \(A\),
it must also meet those of \(B\).

\subsubsection*{Examples}
Prove \(A \subset B\) where:
\[A = \{n \in \mathbb{N} | sin(n) > 0\}\]
\par
\[B = \{n \in \mathbb{N} | sin^2(n) <= sin(n)\}\]
\par
Let \(n \in A\), thus \(sin(n) > 0\). Since \(sin(n) <= 1\) and if \(x <= y\) and 
\(a > 0\) then \(ax <= ay\), we have \(sin(n)sin(n)<=sin(n)\).
Therefore \(n \in B\) so \(A \subset B\).
\par
To prove a statement is false, we must find a counterexample - an example for which a
statement does not hold. Thus, to prove \(A\) is not a subset of \(B\), we must find any
\(x\) in \(A\) but not in \(B\).

Prove that \(A notsubset B\) where \(A = \{3n + 1 | n \in \mathbb{Z}\}\) and \(B = \{6m + 1 | m \in \mathbb{Z}\}\).
\par
\[A = \{..., -2, 1, 4, 7, ...\}\]
\[B = \{..., 1, 7, ...\}\]
\par
We guess \(4 \notin B\), \(4 \in A\).
Proof: Claim \(4 \in A\) this is true since \(4 = 3*1 + 1\). Claim \(4 \notin B\). Suppose for a
contradiction that \(4 \in B\) this would mean \(4 = 6m + 1\) for some \(m \in \mathbb{Z}\).
But then, 
\[3 = 6m\]
\[threedots m = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\]
This is a contradiction! Thus we conclude \(4 \notin B\).


\section*{Proof by Contradiction}

How do we prove that 
\[x^2 + x + 1 = 0\]
has not real solutions?
Proof by contradiction. Assume that there is a solution, \(x \in \mathbb{R}\) and show
that this leads to an absurb conclusion.
\[x^2 + x + 1 = 0 \rightarrow (x + frac{1}{2})^2 + \frac{3}{4} = 0 \rightarrow (x + \frac{1}{2})^2 = \frac{-3}{4}\]

\section*{Union}
The elements of \(A union B\) are all the elements that are in either \(A\) or \(B\). 
\(p \rightarrow q\) means if p is true, so is q. \(p twowayarrow q\) means that if either
is true, both are true.

\subsubsection*{Examples}
1. \(\{x \in \mathbb{R}: x^2 > 1\}\) -> \((-\inf, -1) union (1, \inf)\)
2. \(\{x \in (-2\pi, 2\pi]: sin(x) <= 0\}\) -> \(\{x \in (-2\pi, 2\pi] | sin(x) <= 0\}\) = \(\{x \in (-2\pi, 0] | sin(x) <= 0\}\) union \(\{x \in (0, 2\pi] | sin(x) <= 0\}\) = \([-\pi, 0] union [\pi, 2\pi]\)
