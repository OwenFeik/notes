\chapter*{Introduction}

\section*{What is economics?}
Economics is a study of choice and of human decision making in the face of scarce resources.
Humans have virtually unlimited resources, but lack the meaning to satisfy these.
Thus, economics is the study of why people/``economic agents'' choose what they do.
A firm, for instance, must decide:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What to produce?
    \item How to produce it?
    \item Who to produce it for?
\end{itemize}
As a social science, economics aims to understand the choices of individuals and how these inform the behaviour of larger groups.
Economics is, fundamentally, about human wellbeing. Wellbeing, from the perspective of an economist is the consumption
of goods and services. These goods and services are produced using a variety of resources, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Natural reosurces 
    \item Physical capital; machines, infrastructure
    \item Human capital; labour, intellectual labour, etc
    \item Time
\end{itemize}
Because these resources are finite, humanity needs to make decisions on the allocation of these resources to optimise wellbeing.

\section*{Decision Theory}
An economic agent is always making choices; it is trying to select the best option based on a 
cost-benefit analysis. 
\[\mathrm{Net\:benefit}\:NB = \mathrm{Total\:benefit}\:TB - \mathrm{Total\:costs}\:TC\]
For example, a firm's goal is to maximise profits; they will minimise costs and maximise revenue to achieve this goal.

\subsection*{How do we measure costs?}
While people are generally quite good at evaluating benefits, they sometimes struggle when
trying to evaluate costs. Often, people will, when considering a purchase, simply consider the 
explicit cost; the price on the price tag. However, this ignores the opportunity cost; any
purchase is to the exclusion of other purchases.

\subsubsection*{Example}
Consider 2 individuals sharing a home, with two tasks that need to be completed, say 
cooking and laundry. If person \(A\) is good at laundry but poor at cooking, person \(B\)
with the opposite skill set, it is obviously advantageous for them to trade; to each
attend to their favoured task. However, consider the scenario when person \(A\) is better
at both.
\par
We can model this as a "production possibilities frontier"; modelling the amount of each
good they can produce if they perform a mixture of the two tasks for a certain time. This will
form a linear relationship tracking from the \(100:0\) time spent state through the \(50:50\) to the \(0:100\) state. Depending on the 
exact relationship between their capabilities, trade may nonetheless be advantageous for both 
parties; the yield for \(A\) may be substantially greater when say, cooking, per unit time,
compared to laundry, and thus, having \(B\) perform some of the laundry, even if less efficient,
may increase the total consumption of both \(A\) and \(B\), thus increasing both parties overall
wellbeing. 
\par
To find this solution, \(A\) needed to consider the opportunity cost of performing laundry,
which in fact proved to be greater than instead primarily cooking and trading with \(B\) to have the laundry
performed.
\par
In the language of economics, \(A\) has an \textit{absolute advantage} in both cooking and doing laundry,
however \(B\) has a \textit{comparative advantage} in laundry.

\subsubsection*{Definitions}
\begin{quotation}    
Absolute advantage is the ability to produce a good using fewer inputs than another producer.
\end{quotation}
\begin{quotation}
Comparative advantage is the ability to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another producer.    
\end{quotation}

\section*{Sunk Costs}
When making a decision, one should ignore any costs that have been incurred prior to a decision.
Because these resources have already be used, the perceived loss of them has no real bearing on 
the future outcome of a decision.

\section*{Opportunity Cost}
Total opportunity costs are composed of two seperate parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Direct Opportunity Costs: This is the cost of resources that will be used in the chosen alternative.
    \item Indirect Opportunity Costs: This is the benefits minus the explicit costs of the next best action.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Example}
Say you have three options;
\begin{itemize}
    \item Option A, worth \$3000, cost of \$2500
    \item Option B, worth \$500, cost \$200
    \item Option C, worth \$100, with a \$20 downpayment already payed
\end{itemize}
Thus, you would select Option A. As B is the next best option
this is your indirect opportunity costs. Because B is worth \$300, the total opportunity cost is equal
to \$2500 + \$300 = \$2800. Thus Option A is still worthwhile.

\section*{Marginal Analysis}
Rather than focussing on total benefits and total costs, we should really focus on Marginal Benefits
and costs. Consider whether consuming / producing \(n\) amount of units will be profitable or costing.
i.e. as long as the Marginal Benefit of and action is greater than the Marginal Cost of that action,
we should take that action as a rational agent.

\subsubsection*{Example}
Say we are hiring workers for a store. These workers are payed \$20/hr. The first worker hired is expected
to increased sales by \$60/hr, with additional workers diminishing in value by \$15/hr until they reach \$0/hr.
Thus, the first worker increases net benefit by \$40/hr, the second by \$25/hr etc. So for the first worker,
the marginal benefit will be \$60/hr, while the marginal cost is a constant, \$20/hr. So looking at the marginal 
benfit vs marginal costs for each worker, workers 1, 2 and 3 will have \(MB > MC\) while worker 4 will have \(MB < MC\), so 
we should hire 3 workers.

\subsection*{Calculating Benefit}
Suppose \(NB(x) = TB(x) - TC(x)\). To maximise \(NB(x)\) using calculus, we can differentiate \(NB(x)\) with respect
to \(x\) and set this to \(0\).
\[\frac{dNB(x)}{dx} = \frac{dTB{x}}{dx} - \frac{dTC(x)}{dx} = 0\]
\[\frac{dNB(x)}{dx} = MB(x) - MC(x) = 0\]
Thus the optimal \(x\) is:
\[MB(x) = MC(x)\]


\section*{Microeconomic Theory}
Microeconomics centres around creating models, creating ``rational agents'' built on axioms.
These axioms are as follows: Individual actors are autonomous, individuals have freedom and that individuals matter.
This theory is then compared with real world data and is validated or disproven.
\par
The theory is thus useful for attempting to understand how individual agents can cooperate
with (or counteract) each other within an economic system.

\chapter*{Prisoner's Dilemma}
The prisoner's dilemma; that of two prisoners who are offered a light charge if neither confesses,
a serious charge if both confess and absolution for the confessor if just one confesses.
This model can (and has) been used to understand a variety of situations from board meetings, 
to economics to diplomacy. It highlights that the individual interest is not always aligned with that of the group.
\par
Under the assumption that the only goal of each individual is personal benefit, it makes sense for both to
choose to confess; if the other chooses not to confess, the confessor gains major benefit, if they choose confess,
 the result is indifferent. Thus, this is a model. However, it does not perfectly represent reality. Many agents are
 ``conditional cooperators''; they want to split only when the other person also splits. Thus their action depends
 explicitly on what they believe the other party will do; just like for most people.
\par
\section*{Lesson 1}
This dilemma highlights that individual incentives can be exploited; the optimal for the prisoners here occurs when neither confesses,
however it is optimal from a theoretical standpoint for both to confess. Thus, the system efficiently manages
incentive to exploit the prisoners. This situation can be used as a model for the design of systems; those where
individual incentives are at odds with a designers intent are likely to be unstable and lead to inefficiencies.

\subsubsection{Example}
A local government aiming to reduce carbon emissions by offering a 40\% rebate on vehicles capable 
of using LNG, a lower emission fuel. However, their system was flawed in that it had no usage requirement;
consumers simply purchased \$1000 dollar secondary fuel tanks and where rebated \$20,000+ without actually
using the lower emission alternative.
\par
Thus, this program was a financial and ecological disaster.

\begin{quotation}
``Economics is a highly sophisticated field of thought that is superb at explaining to policymakers precisely 
why the choices they made in the past were wrong. About the future, not so much...''
\par
``However, careful economic analysis does have one important benefit, which is that it can help kill ideas that are completely
logically inconsistent or wildly at variance with the data. This insight covers at least 90 percent of proposed economic policies.''
\par
-- Ben Bernanke
\end{quotation}

\section*{Lesson 2}
In addition, this problem can help us to understand that people will adapt to imperfect systems:
over time, people will come to understand what action they should take in a situation and thus they
will create outcomes that may align with the expected outcome of theory.

\section*{Lesson 3}
In economic systems, we can never know the true, underlying preferences and decision 
making process of an individual; they have private information. This can make it difficult
to design effective centralised systems.
\par
Thus, it can be more efficient to pursue decentralised systems such as markets,
where people act in perfect self interest, thus revealing their underlying incentives, which 
inform their behaviour.

\chapter*{Markets}

\section*{What is a market?}
A market is a mechanism through which buyers and sellers trade a particular good or service with 
near-identical characteristics. These characteristics can include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Type
    \item Delivery Location
    \item Grade and Quality
    \item Time
\end{itemize}
For example, oil varies considerably in chemical compoisition (e.g. sulphur content) and density;
usually the ``Brent'' crude oil price is discussed when the price of oil is referred to; it represents
an independent market with a very specific set of characteristics.

\bigskip 
In a market, buyers supply demand and sellers offer supply. Both agents must consider marginal 
cost and benefit when evaluating a transaction. As they are rational economic agents, they
will only transact when \(MB \geq MC\) for both buyer and seller.

\bigskip
In an indealised perfectly competitive market, there are many buyers and sellers trading exactly
identical goods. These factors inform competition because buyers are aware that they can choose from
a variety of sellers with no differentiation of products. In this setting, an individual does not 
have the ability to manipulate the market through their individual actions; the individual seller
is a ``price-taker'', accepting the market price. Although real markets tend not to be \textit{perfectly} 
competitive, they are often highly competitive.

\subsection*{Demand}
The demand curve will map the number of units for which there is demand at a given price.
In general, as price decreases, demand will increase. This is the thesis of the ``Law of Demand''. 
Other factors can, however, also inform demand includings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Price
    \item Tastes
    \item Price and quality of alternative goods
    \item Income
    \item Future price expectations
    \item Number of buyers
\end{itemize}
How can changes in income alter the characteristics of a demand curve?
\begin{itemize}
    \item For a \textit{normal good}, demand is usually proportional to income.
    \item For an \textit{inferior good}, demand is inversely related to income.
    \item When income changes, we see a \textit{shift} in the demand curve.
\end{itemize}
How about the prices of other goods?
\begin{itemize}
    \item For \textit{substitutes} such as butter and margerine, the price of one good is proportional to demand for the other.
    \item \textit{Complements} have a negative correlation between the price of one good and a complement good.
\end{itemize}
When these prices change, we see a shift in the demand curve.

\subsection*{Supply}
Supply is the complement to demand, representing the quantity of goods sellers have 
on offer for buyers. For a supply curve, price and quantity in general be positively correlated.

\bigskip
Supply can be affected by factors such as technology advances improving manufacturing
efficiency, shifting the supply curve to greater supply. Inversely, supply might be 
negatively impacted by rising prices for input goods (such as commodities).

\subsection*{Market Equilibrium}
Market equilibrium describes a situation when supply and demand are in balance; when the 
quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded. This can be observed graphically as
the intersection of the demand and supply curves. 

\bigskip
This is an equilibrium because neither buyers
nor sellers have an incentive to change their behaviour; if price where to increase, the
additional goods would not be sold; if it were to decrease, suppliers would not find it
worthwhile to produce the demanded goods.

\subsubsection*{Example}
If \(Q_D\) is quantity demanded and \(Q_S\) is quantity supplied, given by these equations:
\[Q_D = 120 - 20P\]
\[Q_S = 20P\]
We can solve the system for equilibrium by setting \(Q_D = Q_S\):
\[120 - 20P = 20P \Rightarrow 120 = 40P \Rightarrow P = 3\]
\[Q_D = 120 - 60 = 60\]
Thus, market equilibrium for this system is found at:
\[P^* = 3\]
\[Q^* = 60\]
What happens when the market is not at equilibrium? Well, when \(P \neq P^*\),
competition will tend to drive \(P\) toward \(P^*\). To identify this equilibrium,
we can observe what would happen if \(P\) where to change; if a point is at equilibrium,
it will return to that state after a disturbance.

\bigskip
For example, if the price is too high, demand will be lower. Thus, manufacturers will
have excess stock and will be incentivised to lower their prices to move their goods,
and as rational agents, will do so.

\subsection*{Comparative Statics}
Comparative statics refer to comparing static snapshots of supply/demand curves
and the effects of market shocks, such as e.g. COVID19 on the supply/demand of hand sanitiser.
COVID19 is an example of a positive shock increasing the demand curve; shifting it to the right and 
thus increasing demand at every price point, and causing an increase in \(P^*\). This is referred to as an \textit{exogenous} effect;
i.e. it comes from a source external to the system.

\bigskip
Positive supply shocks increase supply at ever price point; an example of an \textit{exogenous} effect
causing this might be a technological advance making it more affordable to supply goods. The 
reverse might happen if some disaster occured such as storms wiping out banana crops in Queensland.

\bigskip
In the case of both a positive supply shock and a positive demand shock of equivalent magnitude,
the intersection will tend to simply increase in quantity. The increasing supply places negative pressure on the price while the increasing
demand places positive pressure, thus maintaining \(P^*\). If we don't know the relative magnitudes,
we can still say that there will unambiguosly be an increase in demand, but we can't say for sure
what will happen to the price.

\bigskip
An example of a long term shift could be lobster. Historically, they were seen as a disgusting low
grade food which was extremely plentiful. However, over time they became more respected and seen
 as a restaurant delicacy, and they were overharvested leading to a reduction in supply.
 Thus, the demand has increasing radically increasing price and the supply has dropped significantly,
 also driving up the price. This is how a meal that was \$4 in 1870 might cost \$30 or more today.
Because of the competing forces on quantity, it is difficult to be sure of how \(Q*\) has changed.

\section*{Elasticity}

Elasticity measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to it's determinants. This allows us
to analyse in detail how markets will respond to a given shock, i.e. magnitude in addition to direction.

\subsection*{Demand}

Price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price. If
\(\Delta P\) denotes change in price and \(\Delta Q_D\) denotes change in quantity demanded then 
\(\frac{\Delta P}{P}\) yields percentage change in price and likewise \(\frac{\Delta Q_D}{Q_D}\) yields
percentage change in \(Q_D\).

\bigskip
Elasticity for \(Q_D\) is then given by:
\[\epsilon_D = \abs{\frac{\Delta P / P}{\Delta Q_D / Q_D}}\]
By convention, it is a positive number. We can take a derivative to determine
\textit{point-price elasticity}. Knowing that the rate of change of \(Q_D\) with
respect to \(P\) is given by \(\frac{dQ_D}{dP}\):
\[\epsilon_D = \abs{\frac{dQ_D}{dP}\frac{P}{Q_D}}\]
This is the elasticity at a particular price, rather than for the entire demand curve.

\subsubsection*{Example}
Consider a demand curve of \(Q_D = 120 - 20P\). Find the point-price elasticity at \(Q_D = 20\):
\[\frac{dQ_D}{dP} = -20\]
\[\epsilon_D = \abs{\frac{dQ_D}{dP}\frac{P}{Q_D}} = \abs{-20(\frac{5}{20})} = 5)\]
and at \(Q_D = 100\):
\[\epsilon_D = \abs{\frac{dQ_D}{dP}\frac{P}{Q_D}} = \abs{-20(\frac{1}{100})} = \frac{1}{5})\]

\subsection*{Common Elasticities}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Perfectly inelastic: \(\epsilon_D = 0\)
    \item Inelastic: \(1 > \epsilon_D > 0\)
    \item Unit elastic: \(\epsilon_D = 1\)
    \item Elastic: \(\infty > \epsilon_D > 1\)
    \item Perfectly elastic: \(\epsilon_D = \infty\)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Factors of Elasticity}
A variety of factors can affect elasticity, such as degree of necessity; if a product is necessary,
it's price will affect demand little. Availability of substitutes is another factor; if a product
can be easily replaced by another product, it's likely to be highly elastic.

\bigskip
Elasticity can be used to consider change in revenue cause by a change in price. Understanding that 
a shift upward in price causes a shift downward in demand allows us to see that an increase in 
price will lead to more revenue only if the effect of that change is more significant than the 
effect of the lost demand. Understanding that elasticity denotes how responsive a quantity is 
to the change of it's inputs allows us to derive the folowing:
\[MR(P) = (1 - \epsilon_D)Q_D\]
Thus, the total revenue is maximised at \(\epsilon_D = 1\). For example, increasing price when \(\epsilon_D = 0.8\)
is likely to yield an increase in revenue while doing the same at \(\epsilon_D = 1.8\) is likely to
reduce revenue. 

\bigskip
Elasticity can be considered not only for price, but also for other factors such as income. Income 
elasticity is denoted \(\epsilon_\gamma\). In general, normal goods have \(\epsilon_\gamma > 0\) while
inferior goods have \(\epsilon_\gamma < 0\); demand for normal goods increases with income, while inferior goods
obey the opposite. Necessary goods have \(1 > \epsilon > 0\), while luxury goods
have \(\epsilon_\gamma > 1\), which makes sense; only when income is high will most people consider buying
luxury goods, so elasticity is high.

\bigskip
Cross-price elasticity considers the demand for one good with respect to the price of another good. For
substitutes, \(\epsilon_{AB} > 0\) while for complements, \(\epsilon_{AB} < 0\); if the xbox gets 
cheaper, playstation demand increases; if the xbox price increases, demand for xbox games decreases.

\section*{Behaviours of Perfectly Competitive Markets}
When a price is fixed, the area between the demand curve and the price line is the total surplus gained
by consumers in the market created. In a perfectly competitive market, this is the area above \(P^*\) under
the demand curve. For a producer, the area under \(P^*\) above the supply curve. For a society, the sum of
these areas is described as the total surplus; the total benefit derived from this market for society. This
concept is linked to welfare.

\bigskip
Consider an example of market behaviours in the shift of a market after the legalization of marijuana.
While illegal, marijuana has a relatively high marginal cost because it has to be imported or produced 
in secret, and distributed as such. We would also expect demand to be reasonably low, due to the potential
for arrest and criminal offences. Thus we would expect a relatively high \(P^*\) and a relatively low \(Q^*\).
With the introduction of legal marijuana, we see a seperate but closely related market emerge; one with lower
marginal cost (in general) than the illegal market, and which, being legal, has substantially higher demand.
We would then expect an increase in \(Q^*\), but would be unable to tell for sure the effect on \(P^*\), as
although demand has increased, the marginal cost of supply has probably also been lowered. The introduction
of this legal market does not necessarily mean the end of the illegal market; a group may exist for which
illegal marijuana is fine as long as it is cheaper than the legal variety. Thus, the market will endure a 
massive demand shock resulting in a new equilibrium with significantly lower \(P^*\) and \(Q^*\).

\bigskip
Some groups thus have an incentive to oppose legalisation; pharmaceutical companies who produce substitutes
will oppose the policy as it will decrease demand for their product; alcohol groups for similar reasons.

\bigskip
In an perfectly competitive market, the equilibrium quantity is always going to be the most efficient
outcome in terms of maximising total surplus. Thus, even a market where all actors are perfectly selfish
maximises total surplus for society.

\subsection*{Government Intervention}
\subsubsection*{Indirect Interventions}
Indirect interventions describe factors like taxes or subsidies. Taxation is usually used by governments to
raise revenue. It introduces a \textit{tax wedge} between price paid by buyer and the price received by sellers.
If the tax is imposed on the seller, sellers are only willing to sell if the price they receive is \(\$t\) higher
than their cost, so the supply curve shifts to the left; \(MC = MC + t\). \(t\) can be a constant or percentage;
it doesn't make much difference conceptually. Thus, taxation will increase \(P^*\) and decrease \(Q^*\). Because of 
the reduction of demand, the seller is unable to pass the entire costs of the taxation to the buyer.

\bigskip
If the taxation is on the buyers side, we instead have the demand curve shifting to the left \(MB = MB - t\). Thus,
we experience a decrease in \(Q^*\) and therefore in \(P^*\). Thus resulting in the same outcome as the seller tax 
in terms of effect on total surplus. Tax is given in all cases by \(t = P_D - P_S\) where \(P_D\) is demand price and 
\(P_S\) is the seller price.

\bigskip
A subsidy is essentially a negative tax; \(s = P_S - P_D\). It incentivises trade in the market. If applied to a
seller, it will drive the supply curve down, lower price and increasing quantity. If applied to a buyer, it will 
drive the demand curve up, increasing demand and price.

\subsubsection*{Interventions and Welfare}
The effect of taxation thus is to introduce a \textit{deadweight loss}, a decrease in the 
total market surplus. This is because the perfect efficiency of the equilibrium is disrupted.
In the case of a tax, this happens because the increased price of goods causes people to
not purchase goods they would otherwise buy, resulting in a loss of utility. In the case of
a subsidy, consumers purchase goods they would not otherwise purchase, resulting in the sale of
goods for below their production price, the difference in costs making up the deadweight loss.

\begin{simpleplot}

    \path[name path = deq] (-6, 1) -- (6, 1);
    \path[name path = peq] (-6, -1) -- (6, -1);

    \addplot[fill = blue, opacity = 0.2] fill between [
        of = deq and mid,
        soft clip = {domain = -6:-1}
    ];
    \addplot[fill = red, opacity = 0.2] fill between [
        of = mid and peq,
        soft clip = {domain = -6:-1}
    ];
    \addplot[fill = red, opacity = 0.3] fill between [
        of = p and peq,
        soft clip = {domain = -6:-1}
    ];
    \addplot[fill = blue, opacity = 0.3] fill between [
        of = q and deq,
        soft clip = {domain = -6:-1}
    ];
    \addplot[fill = gray, opacity = 0.3] fill between [
        of = q and p,
        soft clip = {domain = -1:0}
    ];
\end{simpleplot}

This is illustrated in the above chart. The line \(S_t\) shows the supply
curve under a tax on suppliers, with \(Q_{**}\) indicating the new equilibrium
quantity traded. The lighter coloured block here shows taxation revenue for the
government, which contributes to total surplus but is paid for by consumers and
supplies. The blue section of this block is payed for by consumers, while the 
red section is payed by suppliers. The inefficiency introduced by taxation is
apparent in the grey shaded triangle, representing deadweight loss of the 
system due to the tax.

\subsubsection*{Tax Burden}
The effect of a tax will tend to be heavier on the side of the market which
has the lower elasticity. This is intuitive when we consider that those
for who price has little relevance to quantity will continue to interact in
much the same way after a tax, while those with higher elasticity will 
be more likely to reduce quantity due to a tax.

\bigskip
The impact of a subsidy can be understood in much the same way. When a subsidy
is applied, the supply curve is lowered. Thus \(Q_{**}\) will be larger than 
\(Q_*\) and the equilibrium price will be lower. An additional surplus will be 
introduced for suppliers and consumers, payed for by the government. The side 
with more elasticity will derive more benefit from the subsidy than the side 
with lower elasticity. Although the subsidy will create a surplus for consumers
and producers, it will cost more than this surplus and thus net a deadweight 
loss.

\subsubsection*{Price Controls}
Direct market controls can take the form of a price floor or price ceiling.
For each of these, they are \textit{binding} when they are set so as to affect
the equilibrium price, so when they are above the equilibrium price in the case
of floors and below in the case of ceilings. If they are not binding, price
controls have no effect.

\bigskip
In the case of a binding price floor, an excess supply will be created due
to the lower equilibrium quantity. This will lower the equilibrium quantity 
force and result in a loss of consumer surplus, due to reduced competition, 
and a change to supplier surplus, with a loss of volume but an increase of 
margin. It will introduce a deadweight loss, as the increase in supplier 
surplus will be less than the less of consumer surplus.

\bigskip
For a price ceiling, the inverse will occur, with an excess demand created.
Once again, the equilibrium quantity will decrease and this will result in
a loss of supplier surplus and a change to consumer surplus, suffering a
loss of volume but increase in value per transaction. A deadweight loss is
introduced in the lost volume.

\subsubsection*{Quotas}
A quota imposes a maximum quantity traded for a good or service. To be 
binding, a quota must be below the equilibrium quantity. This will have the
effect of setting the quantity to the quantity specified by the quota,
thus increasing price to the relevant point on the supply curve. This
results in a decrease in consumer surplus and a change in consumer surplus,
having essentially the same effect as a price floor. Once again, it creates
a deadweight loss.

\subsection*{Trade}
Countries trade because they have different resource endowments; some countries
have a comparative or absolute advantage in certain industries, which allows 
them to produce these goods more efficiently, providing opportunities to 
increase total surplus through trade.

\bigskip
Despite the various benefits of trade, its impacts are not equally distributed;
it can lead to inequalities, domination of smaller economies by larger ones 
causing national security issues, etc.

\bigskip
Comparative advantage arises when an entity can produce goods at a lower 
opportunity cost than their competition, while absolute advantage arises when a
good can be produced with fewer inputs than used by their competition. In 
general, countries will produce more of the goods in which they have a 
comparative advantage, and export the excess, while they produce less of goods
in which they suffer a comparative disadvantage.

\bigskip
Countries isolated from international trade are said to be in \textit{Autarky}.
This means that only domestic trade is possible in their economies. By
considering a country in Autarky and comparing this to the resultant
market after introduction of trade, we can understand the effect of trade
on a market. The world market will usually be essentially pre-determined, 
making an individual country a price-taker, because it is too small to 
significantly effect the global market.

\bigskip
In the case that \(P_W\), the world price is greater than \(P^*\), the
local equilibrium price, sellers who were selling at \(P^*\) will be able
to export and so the local price \(P^*\) must rise to match \(P_W\).

\begin{simpleplot}
    \addplot[name path = qd, blue, ultra thick] {-x}
    node [pos = 0.2, above right] {\(Q_D\)};
    \addplot[name path = qs, red, ultra thick] {x}

    \addplot[name path = pw, blue, ultra thick] (x, 1)
    node [pos = 0.8, below] {\(P_W\)};

    \addplot[black, ultra thick, dashed] (-1, x)
    node [pos = 0.1, left] {\(Q_D(P_W)\)};
    \addplot[black, ultra thick, dashed] (0, x)
    node [pos = 0.1, left] {\(Q_*\)};
    \addplot[black, ultra thick, dashed] (1, x)
    node [pos = 0.1, right] {\(Q_S(P_W)\)};

    \addplot[fill = red, opacity = 0.2] fill between [
        of = pw and qs,
        soft clip = {domain = -6:1}
    ];
    \addplot[fill = red, opacity = 0.2] fill between [
        of = qs and mid,
        soft clip = {domain = -6:0}
    ];
    \addplot[fill = blue, opacity = 0.4] fill between [
        of = qd and pw,
        soft clip = {domain = -6:-1}
    ];
\end{simpleplot}

For local suppliers, this is excellent, as can be seem on the above graph.
Their surplus has increased by the area of the light red section, with the 
section under \(Q_D\) to the left of \(Q_D(P_W)\) coming directly out of 
local consumer surplus, and remainder constituting the surplus acquired through
international trade.

\bigskip
In this case, the total added surplus for the local market is equal to the area
of the small triangle in the centre. The gains made by the suppliers outweigh
the losses of the consumers.

\bigskip
Intuitively, in the case that \(P_W < P^*\), consumers will be bettered by
imports of goods for which the country is at a comparative disadvantage,
while producers will be harmed by the necessary reduction of \(P^*\) to \(P^W\).
Once again, the total surplus rises, though in this case at the cost of producers
rather than consumers.

\subsubsection*{Trade and Interventions}
An import tariff is a tax applied to goods imported from overseas. This
reduces the comparative advantage of overseas goods, moving the market price
closer to the Autarky price in the case of \(P_W < P^*\). This will result
in an increase of local supply of the good, by artificially making 
local goods more competitive. This will be good for suppliers, but bad
for producers. This tariff inevitably introduces a deadweight loss into
the system, in addition to taxation revenue for the government.

\bigskip
Quotas have the effect of fixing the maximum quantity of good that can be
imported. If a binding quota is applied to a good, it has the effect of setting
the price of a good for a quantity up to the maximum of the quota, at which 
stage the normal local market behaviour resumes (in the case \(P_W < P^*\)).
Thus, it will result in a lower price, but one which is less significant
than is there was no quota. This results in a reduction in consumer surplus
and an increase in producer surplus when compared with the equilibrium.
There is a deadweight loss when compared with the unrestricted market.
A quota introduces a benefit for those who have permission to fill the quota;
because this is limited, not all everyone can benefit from it. A quota
has essentially the same impact as a tariff, in that the losses are in the
imports which don't occur due to reduced foreign comparative advantage.

\subsection*{Market Failure}
We have seen thus far the perfectly competitive markets generate perfectly
efficient outcomes, while government interventions tend to result in 
deadweight losses. However, the reality is that markets operating in an
unfettered fashion often result in outcomes that are socially and or 
economically undesirable. An assortment of causes can cause market failures:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Externalities
    \item Asymmetric information
    \item Imperfect competition
    \item Public goods
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Externalities}

A \textit{negative externality} causes costs of others which aren't borne
by the agent. This could be something like a consumer deciding
to smoke in public; this can cause cancer for the people around them for
which the smoker needn't pay. A \textit{positive externality} occurs when
a decision-maker's action causes benefits for others, which the decision-maker
doesn't receive. An example could be vaccinations; if someone gets vaccinated,
they protect not only themselves but those they come into contact with are
saved from a disease. Because the costs of these actions are not borne
by the decision-maker, they are often not considered when making decisions.

\bigskip
When considering a market, we look at the \textit{private} benefits and 
costs of the individual. Thus, we can interpret demand as \textit{private
marginal benefit} (\(PMB\)) and supply as \textit{private marginal cost}
(\(PMC\)). Thus market equilibrium occurs at \(PMB = PMC\) and \(Q^*\)
maximises private net benefits. To consider a society's broader perspective,
we can add \textit{social} marginal benefits and marginal costs, to arrive
at a socially optimal outcome \(Q^{**}\). If \(PMB = SMB\) and \(PMC = SMC\),
the market equilibrium is socially efficient. This balance can be disrupted
by externalities. The following types of externalities can occur:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Positive externality in production (\(SMC < PMC\)), such as between
    a beekeeper and orchardist. The more honey the beekeeper produces, the
    more efficient the orchardists farm. Thus, the beekeeper is effecting a
    net good for the orchardist, the benefits of which they don't see.
    \item Negative externality in production (\(SMC > PMC\)), such as in the
    case of industrial pollution. A dye factory may pollute a river system,
    reducing the efficiency of the downstream fishery causing social marginal
    cost to be higher than the private marginal cost of the polluter.
    \item Positive externality in consumption (\(SMB > PMB\)), for example
    vaccination. When one gets a vaccination, they contribute to heard 
    immunity, a societal good.
    \item Negative externality in consumption (\(SMB < PMB\)), like smoking
    causing unpleasantness for those around them or incurring health care 
    costs through a socialised health care system.
\end{itemize}

In the above plots, the purple area represents social producer surplus;
the surplus generated when considering social marginal cost, adding this to
the red area yields the surplus considering private marginal cost of 
suppliers and the blue area is the marginal benefit of consumers (and 
society, as \(PMB = SMB\) for this example). In this case, social loss 
caused by a negative externality is given by the sum of the areas where
\(PMC < SMC\). In the first case, that of market equilibrium (\(Q_*\)),
there is a significant social cost, visible as the grey shaded region.
This deadweight loss eats into the total surplus of the society.
In the second case, \(Q_{**}\) or social equilibrium, the price is 
dependent on the social marginal cost of production, and thus the total
social surplus is conserved, with no deadweight societal loss.
Thus, it is clear that the perfectly efficient market doesn't necessarily
result in the maximum social surplus. This is an example of how a negative
production externality might leave to market failure.

\bigskip
For a different example, consider a postitive externality in consumption.
In this case, there will be a deadweight loss at the market equilibrium
because individual agents will lack the incentive to perform an action
that will increase social surplus but not private surplus.

\subsubsection*{Accounting for Externalities}
To coerce the market into behaving in a socially optimal fashion, a
government can encourage people to internalise an externality; get
agents to consider the social costs and benefits of their actions.
If more force is required, a government can directly intervene in a
market, through taxes, subsidies, quotas, etc. Here, a government
is rectifying an inefficiency introduced by a free market, rather
than distorting an efficient market as we have previously observed.

\bigskip
An example of such an intervention to rectify the case of a negative
production externality is a \textit{Pigouvian tax}. This is a tax on
a producer equal to the difference between the social marginal cost
and the private marginal cost, thus forcing the market into the
social equilibrium state, though in this case with a slice of total
surplus benefitting government rather than producers or suppliers.
To be efficient, a Pigouvian must be \textit{exactly} equal to the
externality it aims to resolve.

\subsubsection*{Asymmetric Information}
Asymmetric information occurs when one agent knows more than another.
Because in an ideal market, both sides have perfect information, when
this is not the case issues can arise. When there are goods of varying
qualities and some sections of a market know more about these than others, 
market failures can arise. Goods are categorised into three categories
for the purposes of information.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Search goods} have characteristics which are easy to
    evaluate pre-purchase, such as commodities, groceries or toys.
    \item \textit{Experience goods} have important characteristics which
    are not easily observable at time of purchase, but which teh consumer
    learns about over time. These include used cards, haircuts and travel.
    \item \textit{Credence goods} are goods where quality is both difficult
    to determine at time of purchase, and continue to be mysterious, such as
    vitamins, plumbing or education.
\end{itemize}
For experience goods, the seller generally has more information about the
goods than the buyer. This creates asymmetry. Sellers with lower-quality 
goods may be more eager to sell goods than those with higher-quality goods,
creating a situation known as \textit{adverse selection}. This is where an
offer from an informed party (usually the seller) reveals negative information
about the product on offer.

\subsubsection*{Example}
A classical example of adverse selection is the market for lemons, or used
cars. In a situation where there are three grades of car:
\begin{itemize}
    \item High, 10\% chance of failure
    \item Medium, 50\% chance of failure
    \item Low, 90\% change of failure
\end{itemize}
And buyers value a working car at \$10000 and a non-working car at \$0, while
sellers value cars at \$1000 less than the buyers. We then have these prices
for cars in a market with perfect information:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Quality & Buyers & Sellers \\
        \hline
        \hline
        High & \$9000 & \$8000 \\
        Medium & \$5000 & \$4000 \\
        Low & \$1000 & \$0 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
Thus, we will essentially have three markets transacting at the buyer price
for each car type. A total surplus of \$1000 per car will exist. Even if
neither side knows what grade a car is in, we still have symmetric information.
The value of a car becomes:
\[\frac{\$9000 + \$5000 + \$1000}{3} = \$5000\]
\[\frac{\$8000 + \$4000 + \$0}{3} = \$4000\]
And so, assuming that both sides are risk-neutral; that is they are happy
to transact based on expected value, the three smaller markets combine into
one larger market for all qualities of cars, essentially at random. 
Symmetry is retained, as is the surplus of \$1000 per car.

\bigskip
However, let us now consider an environment where sellers know the grade of
their cars, but not buyers, one with asymmetric information. Buyers have the
same valuation of a random car of \$5000, and so this would be the market
price. However, sellers with high quality cars will not transact at \$5000,
because they value their cars at \$8000. Thus, the market can contain only
medium and low quality cars, changing the value to a buyer to
\((\$5000 + \$1000) \div 2 = \$3000\). Disaster! As this is below the seller
value of a medium quality car, they will also refuse to transact, and the
market will be left selling only low quality cars, at a market price of \$1000.
The total surplus will be only a third of what it would be if all cars where
transacted. Total welfare drops and only the lowest quality goods are traded.
This is adverse selection.

\subsubsection*{Accounting for Adverse Selection}
A variety of mechanisms exist for government intervention to protect against
adverse selection. These include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Legal systems (lemon laws in the US protect purchasers of new cars)
    \item Quality inspections and certifications
    \item Reputation systems, such as those used on eBay or Amazon
    \item Signals such as warranties and service agreements
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
Adverse selection is also prevalent in insurance; when purchasing insurance,
the insuree generally has more information than the insurer. The insurer will
be incentivised to price their insurance at the average cost for all people,
which will disincentivise low risk individuals from purchasing insurance, thus
driving up costs as the average risk of a customer increases. This 
disincentivises slightly less row risk people, and the death spiral has begun.
Governments often resolve this issue in car insurance by mandating its 
purchase, thus forcing even the lowest risk drivers to purchase it. In the case
of health insurance, universal health care can be an alternative that doesn't
suffer this issue.

\subsubsection*{Moral Hazard}
\textit{Moral hazard} arises when one agent engages in risky behaviour because
the other agent bears the consequences of this action. This is an issue in
markets like insurance. For example, after obtaining health insurance one might
(perhaps unwisely) take up unhealthy behaviours because the insurer will foot
the bill for any medical issues. Moral hazard is another example of an issue
with asymmetric information; the seller cannot monitor the buyers actions.

\bigskip
One way to resolve this is by transferring some responsibility to the buyer.
If a car dealer offers a full warranty, and a driver enjoys driving recklessly,
increasing the risk of the car breaking down, then the driver will do so as
it costs them nothing for the duration of the warranty, and the cost to the 
dealer is increased. However, if the dealer instead offers a partial insurance,
meaning that they will pay some portion of the costs associated with a broken
car, but the buyer will also pay some, the driver is now disincentivised from
driving recklessly and is more likely to drive safely. Thus the risk for the 
dealer is reduced and the incentive for bad behaviour from the buyer is 
removed. These systems are seen in practice in places such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Insurance deductables, where insurees pay some fees upon a claim
    \item CEO payment schemes, where salary is perfomance dependent
    \item Grades, where students are incentivised to study
\end{itemize}

\section*{Firms}
In the examinations of markets to date, we have generally considered small,
independent buyers and sellers, a construct which aligns poorly with the
reality of massive corporations. To remedy this, we now examine firms as a
concept.

\bigskip
The role of a firm is to produce; to utilise inputs to produce outputs to
sell onward to consumers. Firms offer a means of coordinating work. They have
numerous benefits. They eliminate the need to negotiate each task a worker
undertakes. They can internalise externalities in different layers of a 
production process, reducing losses. There are many varieties of firms, from
single proprietor entities to larger corporations.

\bigskip
The most basic fact of a firm is, speaking economically, its 
\textit{technology}, the method through which it transforms inputs into 
outputs. These inputs might include labour, capital or raw materials.

\subsubsection*{Example}
Consider a bookbinding firm. The books are bound by a machine, an item of 
capital, which can bind 36 books per minute with a crew of 6 people. With less
workers, more books can be output. The following table describes the quantity
produced for each number of workers:

\begin{center}    
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
        Workers & Output & \(F(1, L)\) \\
        \hline
        \(1\) & \(10\) & \(10\) \\
        \(2\) & \(18\) & \(18\) \\
        \(3\) & \(24\) & \(24\) \\
        \(4\) & \(30\) & \(30\) \\
        \(5\) & \(34\) & \(34\) \\
        \(6\) & \(36\) & \(36\) \\
        \(7\) & \(34\) & \(36\) \\
        \(8\) & \(32\) & \(36\) \\
        \(9\) & \(30\) & \(36\) \\
        \(10\) & \(26\) & \(36\) \\  
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

This is a \textit{production function}, which describes the highest output
(denoted \(Q\)) a firm can produce for every specified combination of inputs.
While firms can use a wide variety of inputs, here we will consider labour 
(\(L\)) and capital (\(K\)). Thus, the production function, shown for \(K = 1\)
in the third column is:
\[Q = F(K, L)\]
As we add machines, the maximum productivity for higher numbers of workers will
increase. While in this example the production function is discrete, in general
we consider the production function as outputting an average, and so represent 
the production function as a continuous multi-variable function.

\bigskip
If we plot capital against labour, we can draw curves of \(F(K, L) = n\) which
show how a given quantity can be produced with different combinations of 
capital and labour. When describing productivity, we use the constructs of 
total and marginal product. Total product (\(TP\)) describes the total quantity
of outputs given some inputs. Marginal product (\(MP\)) describes the increase
in production from an additional unit of input. In the example of \(F(K, L)\),
we can find the productivity of labour by holding capital as a constant and 
taking the limit of \(L\), i.e. take the partial derivative of \(F\) with 
respect to \(L\).
\[MP_L = \frac{\partial F(K, L)}{\partial L}\]
We could do the reverse to find the marginal product of capital. In general,
we assume that the law of diminishing returns applies to both quantities.

\bigskip
The profit of a firm is given by subtracting its total costs, what it pays for
its input, from its total revenue, what it is paid for its outputs. The goal of
a firm is to maximise this value. Let us assume a firm can sell each unit of 
output for \(p\), must pay \(w\) for each unit of labour and \(r\) for each 
unit of capital. Then:
\[pF(K, L) - wL - rK\]
This is the equation which the firm seeks to optimise. While for a simple 
equation this is fairly simple, it will be more complex in a more realistic
scenario. We can simplify the problem by considering that:
\[\pi(Q) = TR(Q) - TC(Q)\]
Where \(\pi(Q)\) is the total profit for a given quantity. Here, \(TR(Q)\) is
simply \(pQ\). However, it is a little more difficult to find a function 
\(TC(Q)\). For this purpose we can look to our production functions. We can
plug in the costs of each unit of production and capital to our production 
function and define \(TC(Q)\) to be the lowest cost combination of different
inputs to the production function to produce \(Q\) units. 

\bigskip
The slope of this function will be governed by the relative costs of capital
and labour. If the two are roughly in balance the function will track 
\(x = y\), if labour is more expensive it will favour capital, etc.

\bigskip
To maximise \(\pi(Q)\), we can differentiate it.
\[\frac{d\pi(Q)}{dQ} = \frac{dTR(Q)}{dQ} - \frac{dTC(Q)}{dQ} = MR(Q) - MC(Q)\]
If we set this equal to 0 to maximise the function, we find that
\[MR(Q^*) = MC(Q^*)\]

\subsubsection*{Time and Costs}
While conceptually we can simply try and maximise this function, in reality it
can be difficult to vary inputs like capital. Thus, we define two \textit{time 
horizons}. In the short term, only one variable can be changed, usually labour,
while in the long term, all variables can be changed. The function examined
previously was for the long term, as it was assumed that all inputs could be
adjusted.

\bigskip
In the short run, we have costs which do not vary with the level of output, as
the input cannot be varied. These are fixed costs. In addition, we have 
variable costs, which are dependent on quantity.
\[SRTC(Q) = FC + VC(Q)\]
For our example of the bookbinder, we can consider a situation where the 
machines are rented on a yearly contract. Say that \(2\) machines have been 
rented for a \(1\) year period. Thus \(F(2, L)\) will give the variable costs.
Here, \(Q\) is capped at \(72\), because the maximum production for a single
machine is \(36\). In this case, the short run function will only coincide
with the long run function in the case that \(2\) units of capital is optimal.
The long run function will always be less than or equal to the short run 
function, because it can always take the value of the short run function, but
can additionally make other optimisations.

\bigskip
Firms generally operate in markets which are quite changeable over both the 
short and long runs. They are influenced by factors such as the behaviour of
their competitors, the present market conditions and externalities. To maintain
viability, they need to solve problems often revolving around these issues:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What technology should the firm use?
    \item How much should the firm produce?
    \item When should the firm exit the market?
\end{itemize}
To answer these, the most useful tool is usually an accurate picture of the 
costs involved. We can use not only long-run total costs and short-run total
costs, but a variety of other, more specialised costs.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Long-run total costs (\(LRTC(Q)\)) are the total cost of producing a
    quantity \(Q\) units with the optimal technology and inputs.
    \item The long-run average total cost (\(LRATC(Q)\)) is the cost per unit 
    for long-run costs. \(LRATC(Q) = LRTC(Q) \div Q\)
    \item Fixed costs (\(FC\)) are short run costs which cannot be changed and
    are not dependent on quantity, but can be recovered by shutting down the
    firm. Most often capital costs.
    \item Variable costs (\(VC(Q)\)) are the short run costs which vary with 
    \(Q\). These include things like labour and material costs.
    \item Short-run total costs (\(SRTC(Q)\)) describe the total cost of 
    producing \(Q\) using the best possible combination of variable inputs.
    \(SRTC(Q) = FC + VC(Q)\).
    \item Short-run marginal costs (\(SRMC(Q)\)) describe the cost to increase
    \(Q\) by \(1\) unit. This is given by the rate of change of the short-run
    total costs, or equivalently, the rate of change of the variable costs.
    \item Average fixed costs (\(AFC(Q)\)) are the average fixed cost per unit
    at a production level of \(Q\) units. \(AFC(Q) = FC \div Q\)
    \item Average variable costs (\(AVC(Q)\)) are the average variable costs
    per unit. \(AVC(Q) = VC(Q) \div Q\)
    \item Short-run average total cost (\(SRATC(Q)\)) describes the average 
    cost per unit in the short run for \(Q\) units. \(SRATC = SRTC(Q) \div Q
    = AFC(Q) + AVC(Q)\)
    \item Sunk costs (\(SC\)) are costs that have already been paid and 
    \textit{cannot} be recovered by shutting down. As these costs are already
    lost, they have not influence on future decision making. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Choice of Technology}
Let us consider first the behaviour of short-run average costs. This is a per
unit measure, made up of the sum of the average fixed costs and average 
variable costs. Average fixed costs is a constant divided by \(Q\), and thus
must be a declining curve. Variable costs are usually increasing functions of
\(Q\), because of diminishing returns usually at an increasing rate. Thus, the
shape of a short-run average cost curve is usually U-shaped, with high costs
due to fixed costs at low \(Q\) values, and high costs due to inefficiencies
in variable costs at high \(Q\) values. The lowest average cost is somewhere
in between.

\bigskip
When a firm is considering which technology to use, the trade off is often 
between an option with a higher capital cost and a lower marginal cost and an
option with a lower capital cost but higher marginal cost. Equivalently, it
might be said that the first option has a constant marginal product while the
second has a diminishing marginal product.

\bigskip
The case of an option with a lower capital cost and lower marginal product is
defined by an increasing average variable cost and decreasing average fixed
cost, resulting in the U-shape. In this case, the marginal cost will increase.
This is because the slope of the average cost is increasing. This marginal
cost function will eventually intersect with the short-run average total cost
function at the minimum of the function. This is intuitive when we consider
that the average total cost can only increase when the marginal cost of 
creating another unit is greater than the average cost of producing a unit.

\bigskip
For the case of a higher capital cost and a constant marginal product, the
short run marginal cost and average variable cost will be constant over all
quantities. In this case the short run average total costs will decline with
increasing quantity.

\bigskip
In the long run, the firm can choose between either of these, and thus will 
choose the method with the lowest cost for a given quantity. Therefore, the
long run average total cost for a given quantity is always less than or equal
to the short run average total cost. In the example, for a low quantity the
option with lower capital costs will be more efficient while for a high 
quantity the option with higher capital costs will be more efficient. The
long run average total cost will be the minimum of the two.

\bigskip
In a general example, the restricting factor for short run average total cost
is capital, and the ability to change this in the long term results in 
dramatically more flexibility. This means that while it might be inefficient
in the short term to dramatically increase production, the long term capacity
is significantly higher. Low quantities of production will tend to be 
inefficient because they struggle to justify their capital costs and extremely
high production quantities will struggle to garner enough capital to produce
efficiently. Thus the \textit{efficient scale} will lie between the two.

\subsubsection*{Firms in Markets}
We have examined how firms make decisions around technologies and inputs to 
minimise costs. Now we move on to consider how firms should act in the context
of a market. How should the firm behave when a change in the market occurs? In 
a perfectly competitive market, there are many suppliers, with free entry and 
exit and essentially identical products. These characteristics essentially 
imply that firms are price takers. 

\bigskip
A firm aims to produce the quantity \(Q^*\) which maximises the profit function
\(\pi(Q)\). Only when this value is positive will the firm operate. For a 
producer the demand curve is essentially flat at the optimal price \(P^*\). 
Thus the total revenue of the firm is given by
\[TR(Q) = P^* \times Q\]
The rate of change of this value is the marginal revenue, and the average
revenue is given by \(TR(Q) \div Q\), which will simply be \(P^*\). Because
the additional revenue generated by selling one more unit is also \(P^*\),
we can see that
\[MR = AR = P^*\]
If we assume that the marginal costs of the firm are an increasing function,
this function must intersect with the marginal revenue at some stage, which
will be the optimal quantity for the firm to produce.
\[MR(Q^*) = P^* = MC(Q^*)\]
The total profits are then going to be given by \(TR(Q) - TC(Q)\), or in per
unit terms, the price minus the average total cost multiplied by the quantity:
\[\pi(Q^*) = Q^*(P^* - ATC(Q^*))\]
Considering that a firm will only operate when it can gain profit from doing
so, we find that for a firm to be happy to operate in a market
\[TR(Q^*) \geq TC(Q^*)\]
These total costs reflect opportunity costs, but not sunk costs. These facts
tell us that over any time frame, the firm should continue to operate as long
as the market price is greater than its average total costs for that time 
frame. Thus, the supply curve is dependent on the marginal costs above the 
minimum average total costs in the short term.

\bigskip
Using this understanding of the behaviour of a single firm, we can begin to
consider how the market as a whole behaves as an aggregate of supplying firms.
Once again, we need to make a distinction between short run and long run 
supply. In the short run, no firms can enter the market, and firms can adjust 
only their short run inputs. In the long run, any number of firms may enter the
market and all inputs are variable. Thus, the total quantity supplied at a 
given price will be
\[Q_s(P^*) = \sum^n_{i = 1}Q^*_iP^*\]
Because all of the individual firms have an upward sloping supply curve, the 
overall curve will share this behaviour. No firms will enter, and only firms
that would prefer to shut down in the short run will close. Whether a firm 
\(i\) profits in the market is dependent on
\[P^* \lessgtr SRATC(Q^*_i)\]
i.e. whether the price is less or greater than the short run average total 
costs for the firm at its optimal price \(Q^*\). If a firm shuts down, it will
suffer accounting losses equal to its sunk costs. In the short run, the 
quantity supplied will match the quantity demanded, and this will yield 
\(P^*\) at intersection.

\bigskip
In the long run, the behaviour of the market is more flexible. If firms are
profiting in the short run, additional firms will be incentivised to enter the
market, increasing supply and lowering price. This process will continue until
the final firm to enter the market has an economic profit of \(0\). In reverse,
firms earning negative accounting profits will exit until the last remaining
firm has \(0\) economic profit. This implies that in a long run market, with
identical firms, each firm will make \(0\) profits and have a horizontal supply
curve. A somewhat strange result.

\bigskip
We can understand this by considering the impact of a demand shock. If prices
rise, in the short term profits will increase for all firms, but in the long
term further firms will enter the market until the newest firm has a neutral
profit. Thus a demand shock will, in the long run, induce a change in supply 
but no change in price. This only applys however, if all firms are identical.
If a new firm have a higher \(LRATC\) than older firms, prices will not fall
back to old levels because the facilities do not exist to produce additional
goods at the old price. Firms will have an increasing supply curve. If a new
firm has a lower \(LRATC\), then prices will fall below the initial price, and
firms will have a decreasing supply curve.

\subsubsection*{Accounting Profit}
Accounting costs and profits are distinct from economic costs and profits. This
is because accounting costs include sunk costs. This lead to slightly different
definitions of accounting costs and profit
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accounting costs are given by \(SC + FC + VC(Q)\)
    \item Accounting profits are given by \(PQ - SC - FC - VC(Q)\)
    \item Opportunity or economic costs are \(FC + VC(Q)\)
    \item Economic profit is \(PQ - FC - VC(Q) = Q(P - ATC(Q))\)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Market Power}
While thus far we have examined the behaviour of firms in perfectly competitive
markets, we can also consider situations where firms have the ability to affect
the market price; where they have \textit{market power}. If a firm has market
power, rather than being a price taker, they become a \textit{price maker}.
A variety of market structures can arise from different combinations of firms.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Many firms with identical products create perfect competition, such
    as the market for wheat or milk.
    \item Many firms with differentiated products create monopolistic 
    competition, such as in the case of novels or films.
    \item Few firms in a market create an oligopoly, such as for tennis balls
    or retail groceries.
    \item If a single firm is the only supplier, a monopoly exists such as for
    tap water or electricity. 
\end{itemize}

The only market structure where a firm can't impact prices is one with perfect
competition. This is precluded by barriers to entry; if a market is difficult 
or impossible to break into, the number of competitors is very limited, such as
for airlines. The other factor that can create market power is product 
differentiation; if a firm can make their specific product more attractive they
gain market power. An example is Apple's massive efforts at branding. We can
see from this that market power is inversely related to competition.

\bigskip
A firm with high market power has a high potential to influence prices, which
can be represented as a steep demand curve for the firms products, as compared
to the horizontal demand curve for products in a highly competitive market. We
can use an inverse demand curve to represent market power. As opposed to 
\(Q(P) = 100 - 5P\) we can write \(P(Q) = 20 - \frac{1}{5}Q\), which tells us
the maximum price a firm could set for a given quantity. For a firm in this
position, total revenue is given by
\[TR(Q) = P(Q) \times Q\]
Which tells us that average revenue is simply \(P(Q)\) for a given \(Q\). 
Because optimal quantity is given by \(MR = MC\). We can take the derivative
of total revenue to find marginal revenue:
\[MR(Q) = AR(Q) + Q\frac{dP(Q)}{dQ}\]
Because we know that the derivative of our demand curve is negative, this tells
us that our marginal revenue is below our average revenue. We can find 
\[P(Q) - MC(Q) = -Q\frac{dP(Q)}{dQ}\]
This statement represents the marginal gain from a single additional unit of
quantity. Here, the statement on the right is the \textit{inframarginal loss};
the loss of revenue from the decrease in price. If we divide through by 
\(P(Q)\) we find
\[\frac{P(Q) - MC(Q)}{P(Q)} = \frac{1}{-\frac{dQ(P)}{dP}\frac{P(Q)}{Q}} = 
\frac{1}{\epsilon_D}\]
This equation is where we find our representation of market power. The left
hand side term is the percentage amount that a firm can raise its prices above
its marginal costs, its market power, known as the \textit{Lerner Index}. This
value is inversely proportional to the elasticity of demand, which makes sense.
The more elastic a market, the less a firm can raise its prices.

\bigskip
An interesting property of this is that even though the company is a monopoly,
fundamentally it must still produce a number of goods appropriate to the 
consumer demand. In the case of a monopoly no real supply curve exists; the 
firm should simply produce the appropriate amount for the demand.

\bigskip
A problem with a monopoly can arise; the goal of the monopoly firm is to 
maximise its individual surplus, not social surplus. Thus, it can often be in
the firms interest to produce a lower quantity which increases its own surplus
but reduces the consumer surplus, resulting in a deadweight loss to society.
This is almost inevitable; monopolies create inefficiencies.

\bigskip
These issues can be addressed through a few means:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pro-competition policy, to promote competition.
    \item Direct regulation, breaking up monopolies through e.g. antitrusts.
    \item Public ownership of the monopoly.
\end{itemize}

An example policy is the pharmaceutical benefit scheme in Australia, which sets
a price for new prescription drugs, and pays a subsidy to the monopoly producer
to make up the losses incurred due to this maximum.

\subsubsection*{Price Discrimination}
Thus far, we assumed that a firm sets a constant price for the same goods to 
all consumers. We know consider whether a firm with market power can increase
profits by charging different prices to different consumers.

\bigskip
If a firm finds that certain groups, such as regions or countries, of consumers
have a higher willingness to pay, they can sell their product to these groups 
at the highest price they're willing to pay for that specific region. Of course
a firm can only set prices if they have high market power. The firm must also
have information on consumer willingness to pay, in addition to distribution
methods which allow for partitioning. In addition, arbritrage can undermine 
this segregation.

\bigskip
Price discrimination can increase overall welfare, because it allows a firm to
make its maximal possible profits. However, it erodes consumer surplus because
consumers will have the product priced based on their own willingness to pay.
In this situation, each unit of product is sold to the customer who values it
the most, and at the maximum price that customer is willing to pay. The 
efficient quantity is produced, but producers receive the entire surplus.

\bigskip
Of course, in reality firms don't know the willingness to pay of their 
customers and can't necessarily prevent arbritrage. We call this idealisation
\textit{first degree discrimination}. Two other variants exist. \textit{Second
degree} price discrimination occurs where consumers don't have observable 
information, but they reveal information by selecting a product. In the third
degree, consumers have some characteristic, such as age, which provide 
information on their willingness to pay.

\bigskip
Despite its unfeasability, first degree discrimination can be used to 
understand many real world systems. An example is why pharmaceutical firms
pursue drugs over vaccines in the vast majority of cases. All of these products
have massive upfront fixed costs and comparatively very minor variable costs.
They have very high positive externalities, the existence of medical goods
has positive social impacts. Thus to encourage development, governments offer
patents to the developers of drugs. Incentives nonetheless skew developments;
for example, firms are incentivised to develop drugs for wealthier groups,
such as middle class people in first world countries, such as cholesterol
drugs as opposed to drugs for poorer groups in third world countries, like
drugs for tropical diseases. 

\bigskip
For these poorer groups, vaccines tend to be much more effective than drugs.
However, they are extremely under provided. This can be understood as the
result of price discrimination. In the case of a drug, a firm can sell it at
a high price to those who suffer a disease, while for a vaccine the firm must
try to distribute it widely at a lower cost. The reason the firm chooses the
drug is because all of its consumers are effectively the same in this case,
meaning the firm need only determine the value of not having the ailment in
order to allow it to use price discrimination, while for a vaccine, individual
differences exist which are not apparent to the firm, precluding first degree
discrimination.

\bigskip
Third degree price discrimination occurs in situations where characteristics of
a consumer give the supplier information about a consumer. An example of this 
can be constructed as the market for movie tickets. If we take two different
demand curves for adults and students we can solve each of them seperately to
find the optimal price for each group
\[Q_A = 100 - P\]
\[Q_S = 160 - 2P\]
Assuming a constant price of \(20\) per unit sold we can find the optimal 
quantity for each of what is now effectively two monopoly markets.
\[\pi_A = Q(P)P - Q(P)20\ = (100 - P)(P - 20)\]
\[\pi_A^\prime = 0 \Rightarrow P = 60 \:\:\: Q = 40\]
\[\pi_S = (160 - 2P)(P - 20)\]
\[\pi_A^\prime = 0 \Rightarrow P = 50 \:\:\: Q = 60\]
Thus, the firm should set a price for students of \(50\) and for adults of 
\(60\). We can compare this to a situation without discrimination by 
considering that the combined demand curve is simply the sum of the two.
We know that the optimal overall price will be somewhere between \(50\) and
\(60\), and calculating using the summed demand curve we find that 
\(P^* = 53.3\) and \(Q^* = 100\). In this case, surplus for consumers is 
higher than in the case of a price discriminated market; though most of this
gain comes from the adult group who are less price sensitive, with the price
sensitive student group actually losing surplus in the aggregate market. This
is an echo of the general case; the price of a more inelastic market will 
increase while for an elastic market the price will decrease.

\bigskip
In the case that a group would not be served without price discrimination,
total welfare actually increases under price discrimination, while if the
total quantity decreases due to discrimination welfare decreases.

\bigskip
Second-degree price discrimination is the situation where the monopolist has
no observable signals and thus must use the actions of consumers to use about
them. It is a strategy that is often pursued by real world firms, who design 
their product offerings around the concept. They can offer specific goods in
certain configurations to appeal to different groups, such as in different 
specifications on electronic devices or luxury offerings in cars like leather
finishing. Through these different qualities, the producer can extract 
information from a consumer.

\bigskip
A consumer may desire to present themself as having lower willingness to pay
by selecting a lower cost option, which incentivises sellers to discourage this
behaviour. An example is in airline flights, where first class passengers are
treated to short queues and luxurious settings while economy options suffer far
worse conditions, in order for the airline to incentivise anyone who can afford
such to select the first class option. In general terms, the firm needs to 
design a suite of options that incentivises customers to reveal their 
willingness to pay. The firm generally wants to reduce the quality of the lower
end goods to make the higher end offerings more attractive. In doing so, they
encourage consumers to give up their willingness to pay.

\bigskip
As an example, consider a situation where there exist regular passengers, who
are willing to pay \(2500\) for an economy flight or \(3000\) for a first class
flight, and wealthy passengers who are willing to pay \(4000\) for an economy
flight or \(8000\) for a first class flight. Here, to encourage the passenger
to purchase the product intended for them, the business needs to set pricest
such that the surplus derived from an economy flight is greater than from a 
first class flight for a regular passenger, and vice versa for a wealthy 
passenger. This could be accomplished by pricing first class flights at 
\(5000\) and economy flights at \(2500\); here, regular consumers will
purchase economy flights because \(2500 - 2500 = 0\) is the greatest surplus
they can obtain while for wealthy passengers \(8000 - 5000 > 4000 - 2500\) so
the first class flight is the greatest surplus they can generate. This process
involves considering \textit{incentive compatability} between the two groups.
Optimally, the airline should set the prices at \(2500\) and \(6500\), as this
sets the surplus for the two options equal for the wealthy passengers, who will
naturally choose the nicer option.

\bigskip
If the airline could reduce the value of the economy class to the wealthy 
passengers through a method that didn't reduce the value as much for normal
passengers, the airline can raise the price of first class tickets. Once again,
an incentive exists for the airline to make economy \textit{truly awful}. The
firm wants to promote its higher end, higher margin products, and as a 
consequence hurts the lowest classes. The benefits gained for customers with
higher willingness to pay are known as \textit{information rents}. By reducing
the value of lower class goods, firms can shrink these rents. For 
consumption goods like milk, higher volumes may be priced differently to
lower volumes. 

\bigskip
As consumer privacy erodes, information rents erode alongside them. If privacy
continues to degrade in coming years, the economy will be highly efficient, but
with extremely low consumer surplus.

\section*{Game Theory}
Thus far, we have analysed economic agents make decisions without overarching 
strategy. They make decisions based on environments which they accept as 
givens. In reality, the actions of agents (or \textit{players}) are dependent
on each other. We call these effects \textit{cross-effects}. Game theory is 
used to study these. Two main branches of game theory exist.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Cooperative Game Theory} is used to understand bargaining and
    matching.
    \item \textit{Non-Cooperative Game Theory} is the primary theory used in 
    this course, and addresses players aiming to better themselves with purely
    selfish decisions.
\end{itemize}

Game theory is important in many scenarios such as auctions, markets or 
politics. It helps us analyse inter-dependencies among actions taken by 
decision makers, and make the best choices in strategic situations.

\bigskip
Game theory models are described as ``Shakespearean''. This is because of the
way we define a game theory problem by splitting it into three parts, in a way
like the setting or stage and actors, the actions the characters can take and 
the interactions between the actors.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The environment; who are the actors in this situation, what 
    information do they have and what are their goals.
    \item Market mechanism; what are the rules of the game, what are the 
    mechanics of the situation.
    \item Strategic action; how do individual decisions affect those of other
    actors.
\end{itemize}

Games are often categorised as \textit{simultaneous} games and 
\textit{sequential} games. Simultaneous, such as rock-paper-scissors involved
players making decisions simultaneously, without information as to the other
players' moves. In sequential games, like chess, players take turns interacting
with the game, with full information about their opponents moves. A few other
pieces of important vocabulary are strategy, which describes the overarching
gameplan of a player, with decisions for every possible situation and 
equilibrium, a situation where each player chooses a strategy which represents
the best response to the strategies of other players.

\bigskip
A strategy should be deep enough to perfectly describe the action that should
be taken in every possible situation. These can be \textit{pure}, where the
action taken in every situation is deterministic, or \textit{mixed}, where the
strategy incorporates a random element. An action is a single decision, a small
part of an overarching strategy. In a game like rock-paper-scissors, the action
taken is the entire strategy.

\bigskip
A \textit{Nash} equilibrium is a situation where each player knows the strategy
of each other player and has chosen the optimal response to these strategies.

\subsubsection*{Prisoner's Dilemma}
Consider a situation where if one player ``rats out'' the other, that player
receives a one year prison sentence and the other receives a twenty-five year
sentence, while if both confess they each receive a ten year sentence. If 
neither confesses, each will receive a three year sentence. We can examine 
this, effectively a simultaneous game, through a game table. Here 
\(a, b\) indicates the value of the outcome to player \(a\), the player whose
options are on the left and to player \(b\), the player whose options are along
the top.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
        & Confess & Not Confess \\
        \hline
        Confess & \(-10, -10\) & \(-1, -25\)\\
        Not Confess & \(-25, -1\) & \(-3, -3\) \\ 
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Here we can introduce a new term: a \textit{strictly dominant} strategy is one
for which the payoff is always higher than for all other strategies. If a 
rational player has access to a strictly dominant strategy, they will choose 
it. If all players have access to a strictly dominant strategy the Nash 
equilibrium will be all strictly dominant strategies. In this case, both 
players can choose the strictly dominant strategy of ``confess'', and so they
will. If either player chooses to confess, then it is optimal for the other
player to confess, as they will receive a ten year sentence rather than twenty-
five. If either player chooses not to confess, then it is optimal for the other
player to choose to confess, because then they will receive a one year sentence
rather than three.

\bigskip
There are a few main techniques for finding Nash equilibria. These include
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cell-by-cell inspection, the process of selecting a cell and checking
    whether the payoff can be improved for either player by changing strategy.
    This process can be repeated until no improvement can be made, indicating 
    an equilibrium.
    \item Elimination of dominated strategies. For a player, we can consider 
    whether all possible outcomes of a decision would be improved by selecting
    a different move; i.e. if that move is dominated. If the strategy is 
    dominated it can be eliminated from consideration. Repeated application of
    the process can collapse the decision pool to equilibria.
    \item Best-response analysis involves determining the best action for a 
    player in response to each possible move of their opponent. In situations
    where the best response for each player is the same cell a Nash equilibrium
    exists.
\end{itemize}

\pagebreak
As an example of elimination of dominated strategies, we can consider the 
tables below. Starting from the top left and moving left to right, top to
bottom, they show the process of elimination of dominated strategies to find
the Nash equilibrium of 5, 4.

In words, these tables tell us that for the row player (player 1), strategy
B is dominated by strategy D, and so will never be played. In this case, C
dominates A for the column player (player 2), and can be eliminated. Now B
dominates D for player 2, so D can be eliminated. For player 1, C dominates
both A and D, so only C will be played. For player 2, B is the best response
to C, dominating C, so the equilibrium outcome is C for player 1 and B for 
player 2. 

\bigskip
Let us consider another game, where two players split a dollar between 
themselves, by each choosing a value between out of 25c, 50c and 75c. If
the sum is less than a dollar, each receives their chosen share, otherwise
neither receives anything.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|}
        & 25c & 50c & 75c \\
        25c & 25, 25 & 25, 50 & \textcolor{blue}{25, 75} \\
        50c & 50, 25 & \textcolor{blue}{50, 50} & 0, 0 \\
        75c & \textcolor{blue}{75, 25} & 0, 0 & 0, 0 \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Our strategies learnt thus far would tell us that there are three Nash 
equilibria in this situation. However, reality doesn't seem to align with
this outcome. We need further tools to properly analyse simultaneous games.
Ideally, we would be able to indentify the most likely outcome, or the 
probability of each possible outcome. In this case, human psychology dictates
a bias towards fairness which skews results toward 50c. Sometimes, however,
there isn't a simple explanation.

\subsubsection*{Oligopoly}
Oligopolistic markets involve a few competing firms, as opposed to the single
firm of a monopoly or the broad competition of a perfectly competitive market.
It turns out that game theory has important implications for the optimal 
behaviour of a firm participating in an oligopoly.

\bigskip
While at first, it may seem optimal for firms to collude and create a monopoly
structure in the market, it turns out that there are incentives for a firm to
deviate from this agreement if possible, and overproduce to increase profits.
To understand this, we can consider a situation known as a Cournot duopoly.

\bigskip
Say two firms \(A\) and \(B\) exist, with identical marginal cost curves of 
\(MC = \$100\cdot10^6\). Here, \(Q_S = Q_A + Q_B\). The inverse demand curve is
\(P = 800 - Q_D\). What is the monopoly outcome for this situation?
\[MC = MR \Rightarrow Q = 350, P = 450\]
If the two firms cooperated, each should produce half of this quantity and 
receive half of the profits. Let us now examine if this is the best possible
outcome for each player. Say firm \(B\) decides to produce this quantity.
Should the other player choose to match? In essence, the demand curve has been
shifted downward by the quantity produced by firm \(B\), and so for firm \(A\)
it looks like 
\[P = (800 - Q_B) - Q_A\]
\[R = (800 - Q_A - Q_B)Q_A\]
\[MR = 800 - Q_B - 2Q_A = MC \Rightarrow Q_A(Q_B) = 350 - \frac{Q_B}{2}\]
The optimal quantity for firm \(A\) to produce is dependent on the quantity
produced by \(B\). This \textit{best-response function} tells us that it is
optimal for \(A\) to produce \textit{more} than the monopoly amount. Thus, both
firms have an incentive to deviate from the agreement, and each must try to 
react optimally to the others behaviour. To find the Nash equilibrium of this
situation, we can use the best response function we found earlier.
\[Q_A = 350 - \frac{Q_B}{2} \:\:\: Q_B = 350 - \frac{Q_A}{2}\]
\[Q_A^* = \frac{700}{3} = Q_B^*\]
The Nash equilibrium has each firm producing the same quantity, which is 
greater than the monopoly quantities. We can extend this concept to a greater
number of identical firms by simply considering player \(A\) playing against
\((n - 1)Q_B\). 
\[R = P(Q)Q_A = (800 - Q_A - (n - 1)Q_B)Q_A\]
\[MR = 800 - (n - 1)Q_B - 2Q_A = MC = 100 \Rightarrow 
Q_A(Q_B) = 350 - \frac{(n - 1)Q_B}{2}\]
We can set \(Q_B = Q_A\) because we know that all of the firms are identical 
and so the optimal quantity will be the same.
\[Q_A = 350 - \frac{(n - 1)Q_A}{2} \Rightarrow Q_A = \frac{700}{n + 1}\]
This yields the same result for our duopoly situation, and generalises to
higher numbers of firms. As \(n\) increases, the equilibrium quantity converges
to marginal cost, as in a perfectly competitive market.

\subsection*{Game Theory and Market Failures}

\subsubsection*{Externalities and Coase's Theorem}
Externalities, as explored earlier, are costs or benefits incurred by an agent
who is not party to a transaction. Externalities can cause market failure 
because they are not accounted for in the private marginal costs and benefits
of individual agents. Earlier we examined how Pigouvian taxes and direct
regulation can be used to manage subsidies, and now we have the tools to 
explore market based solutions, using property rights over the externality to
manipulate the behaviour of market agents.

\bigskip
An example of a situation where this was applied can be found in radio bands in
the United States. In the early years of radio broadcasting, licenses for 
certain frequencies were sold by the newly formed FCC, solving the externality
of clashing broadcasts on the same frequencies. However, as time passed the
inefficiencies in this system became clear as legacy incumbent broadcasters
prevented new players from entering the scene as they possessed the all 
important licences. Ronald Coase introduced a solution where licenses could
be bought and sold independently of the FCC, between broadcasters, arguing that
this system would allow private individuals to solve the externality 
independently of regulation.

\bigskip
The foundation of the was what is known as the Coase Theorem, that if property
rights for an externality are established, and private parties can trade the
externality at a low transaction cost, bargaining will necessarily result in an
efficient outcome.

\bigskip
Consider a situation where a chemical produces chemicals, releasing pollutants
into a lake shared with a boat hire company as it does so. In a situation with
no regulation, an obvious Nash equilibrium is reached on the following table.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
        & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
        0 & 0, 0 & 0, 14 & 0, 15 \\
        1 & 10, 0 & 10, 10 & 10, 5 \\
        2 & 15, 0 & \textcolor{blue}{15, 2} & 15, -3 \\
    \end{tabular}        
\end{center}
Because the chemical plant (row player) has no incentive to limit its output, 
it will always produce 2 units, and the best response of the boat hire company
(column player) is simply to produce 1 unit. This is not, however, the socially
optimal outcome of a 20 unit surplus. To rectify this, property rights could be
awarded to either party.

\bigskip
In the case that property rights are awarded to the boat hire firm, it could
simply ban pollution, forcing a move of 0 from the chemical plant, and ensuring
a surplus for itself of \$15. However, it could instead charge the chemical 
plant a fee of \$10 per unit to pollute the lack. The chemical plant would have
a surplus of \$0, and thus would be indifferent as to the outcome, while the
boat hire firm would gain a surplus of \$20, the socially maximal surplus. By
awarding property rights, a situation was constructed which ensured an
efficient outcome in spite of a negative externality.

\bigskip
It would also work for the rights to be awarded to the chemical firm. In this
case, the chemical firm could of course simply produce 2 units, gaining a 
surplus of \$15. However, this is less than the possible maximum. If instead
the chemical firm charged the boat hire firm \$8 per unit, the socially
maximal surplus would once again be attained, though this time with the surplus
on the side of the chemical firm.

\bigskip
This is obviously an idealisation; in reality transaction costs, and other 
costs such as monitoring pollution levels make it difficult for an efficient
outcome to arise. For this reason, Coase argued that it was important to ensure
that the initial allocation of property rights was efficient, because the 
secondary market may not be able to find this outcome.

\subsubsection*{Public Goods}
For a public good, such as national defence, two important characteristics need
to be considered for proper management to occur.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Are these goods \textit{excludeable}? Can others be prevented from
    utilising them?
    \item Are these goods \textit{rivalrous}? If one person uses them, is the
    quantity available for others reduced?
\end{itemize}
Goods that satisfy either of these two properties are \textit{not} public 
goods. All goods can be categorised according to the following table, with
most goods being private goods.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|}
        & Rivalrous & Non-rivalrous \\
        \hline
        Excludeable & Private goods & Club goods \\
        \hline
        Non-Excludeable & Common resources & Public goods \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}        
\end{center}

In a competitive market, public goods are under-provided, because they 
generally entail a positive externality in production, and the fact of 
non-excludeability leads to what is known as a \textit{free-rider problem}:
where people receive the benefit of a good without paying for it. 

\bigskip
An example could be a Jeweller and a Cafe considering hiring security guards.
Obviously, the marginal benefit of the Jeweller is much higher, but if the
Jeweller hires guards both firms will benefit. The social marginal benefit
can be found by adding the two marginal benefit curve. If a constant marginal
cost of security exists, the Jeweller will hire security at its own marginal
benefit, with the cafe hiring none as the cost is well above its marginal
benefit. However, the cafe will nonetheless benefit from the security, and the
quantity of security hired will be below the socially optimal level, where 
\(SMB = MC\). This is an example of a \textit{free-rider problem}.

\bigskip
It is difficult to find a private solution for this, and so government 
intervention is often required, through e.g. public provision of security.
Alternately, they can assign property rights to create excludeability in the
market, a solution less applicable to the example of security.
