\section*{Databases}

\subsubsection*{Data and Information}

While data is known, discrete facts that have been stored and recorded,
information is data placed in context and presented. It is much more useful to
humans. SQL is a tool for extracting information from a database.

\subsubsection*{Metadata}

Metadata is \textit{data about data}. For example type, length or description.
It helps us to keep data storage consistent, useful and meaningful.

A database is a large, integrated, structured collection of data, used to model
some real world enterprise as entities and relationships. A Database Management
System or DBMS is used to interface with a database. Databases differ from
simple programs interfacing with files by avoiding redundancy and ensuring
consistency. They also allow better file sharing and can improve development
speed and reduce maintenance.
