\chapter*{Substring Problem}
Consider the problem of finding repeated substrings of length m in a string of length n e.g.:
\begin{quotation}
\begin{center}
fat.rat.eat.bat.cat.eat.fat.rat
\end{center}
\end{quotation}
To undertake this problem iteratively, we could take the first substring of m characters from
the input string, compare this to each set of characters in the string and note when we get a match.
This program has a running time of \(mn^2\), because each character forms one substring, which is 
compared to each other substring. Thus, it is a quadratic time algorithm; if its input size is 
doubled, it will take four times as long.
