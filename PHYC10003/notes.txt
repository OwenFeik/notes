First section: Classical Mechanics (6 Weeks)

Galilieo's Principle can describe an event using two variables (x, t) and (x', t')
In this case, x' = x + vt and t' = t. This treats the laws of mechanics as the 
same in any inertial frame; a frame moving at a constant speed. While these laws
function at low velocities, they start to break down as v approaches c.

There are seven fundamental quantities, of which three are relevant; length, time
and mass. These seven can be used to define all other physical quantities.

Dimensonal analysis is the process of taking a formula, breaking it down into input
units, and solving this equation to ascertain whether the formula is accurate.

e.g. v = v0 + at^2/2
L/T = L/T + L/T^2*T^2
L/T = L/T + L -> incorrect
