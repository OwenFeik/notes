\chapter*{Motion}

\section*{Galiliean Mechanics}
Galilieo's Principle can describe an event using two variables (x, t) and (x', t')
In this case, x' = x + vt and t' = t. This treats the laws of mechanics as the 
same in any inertial frame; a frame moving at a constant speed. While these laws
function at low velocities, they start to break down as v approaches c.

\section*{Fundamental Quantities}
There are seven fundamental quantities, of which three are relevant; length, time
and mass. These seven can be used to define all other physical quantities.

\section*{Dimensional Analysis}
Dimensonal analysis is the process of taking a formula, breaking it down into input
units, and solving this equation to ascertain whether the formula is accurate. e.g.
\bigskip
\begin{center}
Fundamental quantities: length (\(L\)) and time (\(T\)).
\end{center}
\[v = v_0 + \frac{1}{2}at^2\]
\[\frac{L}{T} = \frac{L}{T} + \frac{L}{T^2}T^2\]
\[\frac{L}{T} = \frac{L}{T} + L \Rightarrow \mathrm{incorrect}\]

\section*{Kinematics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Position is defined as a vector indicating the distance from a reference point, the origin. It is directional.
    \item Displacement is the change in \(x\) or position. i.e. the \(\Delta x\).
    \item Velocity is the ratio of displacement to time. 
    \item Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Velocity}

On a graph of \(x\) vs \(t\), average velocity is the slope of the line that connects two points.

\medskip

Average speed is total distance divided by time. Thus, it is always positive.

\medskip

Instantaneous velocity is obtained at a single moment in time, it is given by the slope of a curve
at that point in time, i.e. 
\[v_t = \frac{dx}{dt}\]

\subsection*{Acceleration}
Acceleration is a vector; it has direction and magnitude. Acceleration can be expressed
in \(ms^{-2}\) or in units of \(g\): \(9.8ms^{-2}\).
\[a_{\mathrm{avg}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{t_2 - t_1} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}\]
\[a = \frac{dv}{dt}\]
For many cases acceleration is constant, such as for objects falling due to the influence of gravity.
In these instances, the equations of constant acceleration can be used. Where \(s = x - x_0\).  These include:
\[v = v_0 + at\] 
\[s = v_0 + \frac{1}{2}at^2\]
\[s = vt - \frac{1}{2}at^2\]


\section*{Vectors}

A vector is a mathematical object with magnitude and direction. Position, velocity and acceleration
are examples of vector quantity. Scalar quantities, such as speed, don't have a direction.

\subsubsection*{Operations}

The vector sum, or resultant vector is the net displacement (or velocity, acceleration, etc)
of two or more vectors.
\[\vec{s} = \vec{a} + \vec{b}\]
Vector addition is commutative. \(\vec{a} + \vec{b} = \vec{b} + \vec{a}\) is the commutative law.
Vector addition is also associative. Any order of addition will yield the same result. 
\par
A negative sign reverse vector direction.
\[\vec{b}+(-\vec{b}) = 0\]
We use this to define vector subtraction.
\[\vec{d} = \vec{a} - \vec{b} = \vec{a} + (-\vec{b})\]
These rules hold for all vectors, irrespective of what quantity they depict. Obviously, only
vectors of the same type, with the same units can be added. This can be checked with dimensional 
analysis.

\subsubsection*{Components}

Rather than adding them graphically, one can add vectors by breaking them down into their
components. Components in two dimensions can be found with:
\[a_x = a \cos(\theta) \:\mathrm{and}\: a_y = a \sin(\theta)\]
\[a = \sqrt{a^2_x + a^2_y}\]
In \(3\) dimensions we need more components so we use \(a, \theta, \phi\) or \(a_x, a_y, a_z\). 
Unit vectors. A unit vector has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Has magnitude \(1\)
    \item Has a particular direction
    \item Lacks dimension and unit
    \item is labeled with a hat: \(\hat{i}\)
\end{itemize}
\[\vec{a} = a_x\hat{i} + a_y\hat{j}\ (+ a_z\hat{k})\]
\(a_x\) and \(a_y\) alone are scalar components. Vectors can be added with these components:
\(r_x = a_x + b_x\) etc. To subtract two vectors, we substract components: \(r_x = a_x - b_x\) etc.

\subsubsection*{Rotations}

Because vectors are independent of their coordinate system, we can rotate the system while
maintaining the vector.
\[a = \sqrt{a^2_x + a^2_y} = \sqrt{a'^2_x + a'^2_y}\]

\subsubsection*{Scalar Multiplication}

To multiply a vector by a scalar, we simply multiply each component by the scalar. The direction
is unchanged unless the scalar is negative, in which case it is reversed.
\[3a = 3a_x\hat{i} + 3a_y\hat{j}\]

\subsubsection*{Dot Product}

The dot product or scalar product of two vectors results in a scalar where a and b are magnitudes and
\(\phi\) is the angle between the directions of the tow vectors.
\[\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = ab\cos(\phi)\]
Dot product is the projection of one vector onto another. When \(\theta = 90\degree\) the dot product
is \(0\).

\subsubsection*{Vector Product}

The vector product is another ay of multiply two vectors, also known as the vector product.
\[c = ab\sin(\phi)\]
If \(a\) and \(b\) are parallel or antiparallel the vector product is \(0\). It is at a maximum
when they are perpendicular. The vector product is not commutative.
